## 🔷 Natural Language Processing
**Transformers, sentence embeddings, and semantic similarity**

- **[Named Entity Recognition (BERT)](https://github.com/malinphy/named_entity_recognition)**  
  Built a transformer-based NER system using a pre-trained BERT encoder.  
  - Token-level classification with fine-tuning  
  - Emphasis on generalization and sequence labeling accuracy

- **[Question–Answer Matching (Universal Sentence Encoder)](https://github.com/malinphy/quick_response_generator)**  
  Designed a semantic QA matching system using sentence embeddings.  
  - Encodes questions and candidate answers into a shared vector space  
  - Retrieves best-matching answers via cosine similarity  
  - Implemented in TensorFlow / Keras

- **[Natural Language Inference with Sentence Embeddings](https://github.com/malinphy/natural_language_inference)**  
  Modeled logical relationships between sentence pairs using embedding similarity.  
  - Trained to distinguish entailment vs. non-entailment  
  - Focus on representation learning and metric optimization

- **[Sentiment Classification (Twitter Dataset)](https://github.com/malinphy/sentiment_classification)**  
  Multi-class sentiment classification using deep neural networks.  
  - Text preprocessing and feature engineering  
  - Evaluated on large-scale social media data

## 🔷 Search & Recommender Systems
**Candidate retrieval, ranking models, and personalization**

- **[Two-Stage Recommender System](https://github.com/malinphy/recommender_sys/tree/main/YouTube/anime_dataset/dataprocess)**  
  Implemented an end-to-end recommender pipeline inspired by YouTube’s architecture.  
  - **Retrieval stage** to efficiently narrow candidate items  
  - **Ranking stage** to score and order personalized recommendations  
  - Clear separation of system components for scalability

- **[Convolutional Sequence-Based Recommender (Caser)](https://github.com/malinphy/Caser_Model)**  
  Implemented a sequential recommendation model using CNNs.  
  - Captures short-term and long-term user behavior patterns  
  - Focus on temporal dynamics in user–item interactions

- **[Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/malinphy/neural_collaborative_filtering)**  
  Neural network–based matrix factorization approach.  
  - Learns non-linear user–item interactions  
  - Baseline comparison against traditional MF methods
- **[E-commerce Search System](https://github.com/malinphy/e_commerce_search)**
  - Engineered a three-stage e-commerce search systemusing fine-tuned deep learning models, (retrieval, pre-ranking, re-ranking)
  - Two-tower and cross-encoder architectures optimized for product relevance.
