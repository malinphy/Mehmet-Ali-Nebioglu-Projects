## Mehmet Ali Nebioglu
**Machine Learning Engineer | NLP & Recommender Systems**

I design and implement deep learning systems with a focus on **Natural Language Processing** and **Modern Recommendation Systems**.  
My work includes representation learning, ranking models, and large-scale similarity systems.

## 🔹 Natural Language Processing
**Sentence embeddings, transformers, and semantic understanding**

- **[Named Entity Recognition (BERT)](https://github.com/malinphy/named_entity_recognition)**  
  Transformer-based NER system using a pre-trained BERT model to classify named entities in text sequences.

- **[Question–Answer Matching (Universal Sentence Encoder)](https://github.com/malinphy/quick_response_generator)**  
  TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a semantic matching system that retrieves the most relevant answers to user queries using sentence embeddings.

- **[Natural Language Inference with Sentence Embeddings](https://github.com/malinphy/natural_language_inference)**  
  Detects logical relationships between sentence pairs by optimizing similarity in embedding space using Universal Sentence Encoder (USE).

- **[Sentiment Classification (Twitter Dataset)](https://github.com/malinphy/sentiment_classification)**  
  Multi-class sentiment analysis using deep neural networks on large-scale social media data.

## 🔹 Recommender Systems
**Retrieval, ranking, and personalization at scale**

- **[Two-Stage Recommender System](https://github.com/malinphy/recommender_sys/tree/main/YouTube/anime_dataset/dataprocess)**  
  End-to-end recommendation pipeline inspired by YouTube’s architecture:
  - Candidate retrieval to narrow item space  
  - Ranking model to generate personalized recommendation lists

- **[Convolutional Sequence-Based Recommender (Caser)](https://github.com/malinphy/Caser_Model)**  
  Personalized sequential recommendation using convolutional neural networks to capture temporal patterns in user behavior.

- **[Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/malinphy/neural_collaborative_filtering)**  
  Deep learning–based matrix factorization approach for learning non-linear user–item interactions.

## 🔹 Experimentation & Statistics
- **[A/B Testing & Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/malinphy/stats)**  
  Practical implementations of hypothesis testing, experimental design, and statistical evaluation methods.
